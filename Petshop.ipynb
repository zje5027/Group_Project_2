        "For my ER diagram I Tried to make everything that the customer interacts with on the left and everything the business interacts with on the right. The six entities I chose are : customer , rewards program, animals , enclosures, food, and transactions. The way I work though it in my head is as follows, a customer in order to be considered a customer must initiate a transaction. A certain number of Animals or Food are bought through the transaction which was initiated by the customer. If the customer has a rewards program, then a discount is assigned to the transaction that is initiated by the rewards member. On the business enclosures are assigned to animals and food is assigned to them as well."
